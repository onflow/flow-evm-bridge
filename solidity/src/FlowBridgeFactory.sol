 * @title FlowBridgeFactory
 * @dev Factory contract to deploy new FlowEVM bridge contracts, defining Cadence-native assets in EVM. Cadence & EVM
 * contract associations are maintained in a deployment registry. This factory is enabled to deploy contracts via
 * registered deployer implementations, each of which handle the deployment of a single templated contract indexed by
 * a human-readable deployer tag. This setup modularizes each key component of the EVM side of the Flow EVM VM bridge,
 * allowing new asset types to be added by simply adding a new deployer implementation or updated factory contract
 * to be swapped out without affecting the underlying associations between Cadence and EVM contracts.
